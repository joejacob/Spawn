# Spawn
A web application for spontaneous social events. Spawn is a project for CS 316 - Database Systems at Duke University, created by Sam Ginsburg, Ethan Gottlieb, Joe Jacob, and Greg Mckeon.

## Code Structure Overview
Spawn was created using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the Meteor Javascript fullstack framework. We also used the Facebook Graph API, Google Maps API, and Bootstrap.

The code structure follows standard Meteor guidelines. The lib folder contains all collections, the app router, and global variables. The server folder contains server code including the setup of facebook connections. The client folder contains all CSS and HTML for the app in the form of templates, as well as matching client-side javascript code. 

## Compiling and Deploying
To compile, type "meteor run" into the terminal in the root directory, and visit "http://localhost:3000/". We have also deployed the app at www.spawn.meteor.com

## Current Implementation Limitations
The app is fully-functional. We will continue to improve UI and add extra features.
